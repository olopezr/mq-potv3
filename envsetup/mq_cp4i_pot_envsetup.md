# Setup environment for CP4I PoT

## Connect to your Virtual Desktop Image

1. As a CP4I PoT attendee you should have received an email with instructions to connect to a Virtual Desktop Instance which you will use to execute the labs in this PoT. The email provided the details for connecting to you VDI.

	**Note**:If you did not receive an email for the PoT or your email did not include the following information, your instructor will provide the required information.

1. Copy the password then click *Desktop* URL.

1. The Linux desktop appears. You are now logged in as *student*. You'll notice the toolbar on the left. This is used to control the VNC settings. You will use it mostly for copy/paste from outside the VNC desktop. You can hide the toolbar by clicking the arrow on the side of the toolbar.

## Connect to the Red Hat OpenShift cluster

Your attendee email also included a URL to connect to the Red Hat OpenShift cluster where you will execute the labs. The name of the cluster will vary depending on which one has been reserved. The example below shows the **Chopper** cluster.

**Note**:If you did not receive an email for the PoT or your email did not include the following information, your instructor will provide the required information.

You will also receive a userid to use throughout the PoT. Your email will include the name of the cluster and userid. The userids are defined in an LDAP for the cluster. For example if **Chopper** is the cluster, your email will specify chopper/chopperxx where xx is your student number. If the cluster is *chopper*, you will receive  **chopper/chopperxx**.

The userid will also be the assigned name of a project (namespace) for you to work in. The project will be yours alone throughout the PoT. No one else will have access to your project and you will not have access to any other student's project.

Important - "Cluster *chopper* and Project *chopper14* were the cluster and the project name used to document this setup. Your assigned cluster and userid/project could be different. Whereever you see *chopper* or *chopperxx* in the instructions or screen shots make sure to substitute the ones assigned to you!"

1. From your email, copy the URL for the OCP Console.

1. Paste the URL onto the clipboard of the VDI.

1. If you have been logged into the *Developer* perspective, click the drop-down next to Developer and select *Administrator*.

	![](./images/image104c.png)

1. You are now in the *Adminstrator* perspective and logged it with your assigned userid. Your project (namespace) is visible as well as *cp4i*, *cp4i-apic*, *cp4i-tracing*. You will only use your project (e.g *chopper5*) for this PoT.

	![](./images/image104e.png)

	You will be in your assigned namespace. There are many other namespaces in OCP, but you will only be permitted to use yours so as not to affect the other users.

### Connect to the Red Hat OpenShift cluster thru *oc* command
